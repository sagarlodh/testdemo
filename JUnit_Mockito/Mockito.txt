We need to add MOCKITO dependency along with JUnit
 <dependency>
            <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
            <artifactId>mockito-all</artifactId>
            <version>1.10.19</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>

STUB :
``````
-a STUB is a sample implementation of the a service basically the 'Dependency', which return some dummy data
		a class with some values
-it is used for Unit Testing
-we create it in test/java/

MOCK :
```````
- concept of defining and returning values dynamically in the TEST and checking them, therefore
	we do not need to define a hardcoded STUB
- argmument matchers concept for checking for multiple fetched values
- by default, for all methods that return a vlaue, a mock will either return null, a primitive wrapper value
	or an mpty collection
- when ...  thenReturn ....

BDD (Behaviour DriveN Development) :
````````````````````````````````````
- GIVEN			--> 	the data
- WHEN			--> 	called
- THEN			--> 	do this

- given ...  willReturn ....

Some more Annotation for MOCK :
`````````````````````````````````
	helps us to autoWire variables, assignings, etc,.


- @Mock 				: we can use this to declare a 'mock' for a class and no need to assgin it inside every method for further use
							@Mock
							<type> <varname>
- @Runwith				: for above thing to work, this should be placed above the class with @Runwith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
- @InjectMocks			: helps us in automatically assigning the mock used method to the variable this is declare with
							@InjectMocks
							<type> <varname>
- @Captor				: to produce captors for storing and rechchecking stuff
