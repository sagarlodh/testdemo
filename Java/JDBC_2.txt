we can use JDBC statements and connections to read and update
 from the DB but this required hardcoding

bt idfwe have dynamic queyr which has placeholder or parameters,
in tht case we should go for Prepared Statements
- create a prepared statement
- inserting parameters
- executing the statement
- reusing the statement
- prepared statment performance
- Syntax :
``````````
	String sql = "select * from employee were employee_id = ? ";
	PreparedStatement p = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
	p.setLong(1,<value>);			// 1 here denotes the first index parameter

These statements are fast..as multiplr pasrsing of statements are not needed
