- enables functional programming
- readable and concise code
- better APIs
- support for parallel processing
- functions a values
- ' -> '
- use Intefaces with same return type and one method
- typep inference is done
- '@FunctionaInterface' - to denote to Functional interface
- wrapper concept
- closure concept
- 'this' ref inside the lambda points to static main and gives error
	outside as other seperate method , it points to the strong reference of MAIN
- we can use method reference while calling static functions
- we can use 'forEach' with lamda to print all elements in the LIST
- we can use STREAMs for doin multiple ops on each element in the list as well
