Weak Hash Map :
```````````````````
- 1 NULL as a key and multiple NULL as values
- fail fast iterator
- maintains insertion order unlike Hash Map

Identity Hash Map :
```````````````````````
- special implementation of Map which doesn't use '@hashCode' and '@equals(obj)' as other maps
- uses 	[ equality operator '==' ] 	to compare keys and values
- faster as reference quality check instead of logical equality.
- keys doesn't need to be 'Immutable'


Enum Map :
```````````````
- A specialized Map implementation for use with enum type keys
- maintains order
- not synchronized i.e not thread safe ---> fail safe
- high performance, faster than Hash Maps
- doesn't allow NULL as key
