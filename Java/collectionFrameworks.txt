Collecctions in JAVA
``````````````````````````````
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes 
(ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

JCF from JDK [ 1.2 ]
````````
A set of classes and interfaces that implements commonly reusable collection data structures

- works in a manner of library
- JCF provides both interfaces that defines collections and classes that implement them

advantages :
	- APIs				- reduces programming effort		- increases speed and qulity
	- support algebric calculation		- thread safety			- immutablity
	- extensibility
````````````````````````````````````````````
All interfaces and their sub domains :
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Iterable <T>:
	- Collection
		- set
			- sortedSet
		- List
		- queue
			- blockinQueue
````````````````````
JCF also comprises
``````````````
Map<K,V> :
	- sortedMap
	- concurrentMap
``````````````````````````````````````````````
Thread Safe implementations :
1] CopyOnWriteArraySet<E>
2] Vector<E>
3] CopyOnWriteArrayList<E>
4] BlockingQueue
5] HashTable<K,V>
6] ConcurrentHashMap<K,V>
