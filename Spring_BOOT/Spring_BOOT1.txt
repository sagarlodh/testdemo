a GO TO FAST WAY of creating and launching web applications

Spring acts a conatainer for diff services and this conatiner is called

- really quick

- production ready
 	
parent contains all maven configs
--> start the app
--> create a servlet container

we can use it to customise spring application itself like deriving certain predefined
proeprties of key-value pairs to extract

To create a jar file for application we need to open the project folder
in SPRING BOOT CLI :

	[1]--> mvn clean install : to create a jar file for our application to run
 
	[2]--> java -jar target/<result from [1]-- jar name>

	if we want 'war' file then go to pom.xml and then change the packaging tag to 'war'

ACTUATOR :

	we need to add the dependency and then if 

		-> http://localhost:8080/health 	: to get the health info like disk space, uptime of the database, info on server etc.

		-> in management.port=9001 			: here we can call the actuator health
