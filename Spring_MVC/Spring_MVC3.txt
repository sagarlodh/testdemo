Exception Handling :
````````````````````
we can throw any exception from the controller class and then also define a class with annotation @ExceptionHandler(value=Exception.class),
which returns an "EXCEPTION" which inturn is nothing but another customised .JSP error file

@ControllerAdvice : if used on any new class, we can define all the exceptions in it and then if an exception is encountered in
					the controller class then, it will search an exception handler in this defined class.
					-> also we dont need to seperately define so many exceptionHandlers inside Controller cass

@ResponseStatus : --> get HTTP Headers extension
				  --> 200 OK
				  --> can be used to send a customised status error code when an error is encountered
				  --> EG : @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.<code of the error occurred in string>)
				  --> EG : for above example we can use --> HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
