OAuth
`````````````
we need to add dependency

authorization of services by services

we can create tokens here too by JWT which will have limited access fr working fofr the app

--> contains user allowed permissions
--> trustable (cannot be tampered)
`````````````````````````````````````````````

TERMINOLOGIES : 
`````````````````

[1] RESOURCE (protected sought) : whata is being sought
[2] RESOURCE OWNER	: the user / who can grant access to the resource
[3] RESOURCE SERVER : server hosting the resource...eg : google drive for
[4] CLIENT : that application which needs access to the resource
[5] AUTHORIZATION SERVER : this is implemented with the RESOURCE SERVER which implements the sevurity of the whole authorization process
							--> also issues access tokens to the client


OAuth Flows : 
`````````````
[1] Authorization Code Flow ---
	
		exchange of diff entities to make sure user is able to connect the client to the resource owner and server

		--> resource owner telling the client to access the Resource server
		--> Client uses the Auth server to access the Resource Server.
		--> Auth server contacts the Resource Owner to verify the Client
		--> Resource Owner verifies the Client
		--> Auth server sends the Auth Token to the client
		--> Client uses this Auth Token to access the Auth server 2nd time
		--> Auth server gives the Client the Access Token
		--> Client uses this Access Token to send request to the Resource server
		--> Resource server sends the requested data/file

[2] Implicit Flow ---

		only diff from Flow 1 is that there is no Auth Token but direct Access Token after Resource Owner verification

[3] Client Credentials Flow ---

		for super trusted clients
