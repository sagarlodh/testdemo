NOSQL / MongoDB
`````````````````````````````
non-relational DB
schema less 
avoids joins
	aggregate oriented : key-value / document / column-family (ACID inside independently)
	graph oriented : graph (follows ACID)
NOSQL follows 'BASE'
mongoDB is document type
easy to scale
used for distributed data stores with huge storage req.
Mongo DB supports JSON mostly....also BSON (binary JSON)
uses key-value and collections databases
no triggers
it is the one of the best-fit for hierarchial data
can be scaled horizontally
MongoDB uses 'CAP' theroerm : consistency, availability, partition tolerance (only two u will get)
encryptions present and failover mech too
