Indexes
``````````````````
	" basically concept of a type of a collection which comprises of documents where
	  a particular value is taken (type of primary key in SQL)....so when we need a 
	  document, we query the index value and the search is performed in the 
	  index collection....on retrieving the req index, we are then pointed to the 
	  respective document "
improve query exec
known as IXSCAN
	-full doc scan is COLLSCAN
stores sorted field values
uses B-tree data structure
we can aff multiple fields as indexes

Default index	:	_id
    - we can change the _id of a doc as our need bt it needs to be unique
    - can not be deleted 

db.<collectionName>.getIndexes() 					- an array of objects (index)
db.<collectionName>.createIndex( { <keyname>: [1/-1]}, <options> ) )	- to create an index in ascending/descending
Options :
	{ background: true }		- to not block other ops
	{ unique: true }		- to create an unique index
	{ name: "<indexName>" }	- to create a custom index
Query performance :
	db.<coll>.explain().<method>		- tells us how the query is performed
Delete Indexes :
	db.<collec>.dropIndex( { <fieldName>: 1 } )	- drop this index
	db.<collec>.dropIndexes( )			- drop all indexes
